# Mini_snake_game
Simple snake game like from nokia mobile phones.

This is a very simple implementation of the game. It doesn't use any OOP principle.

This game is made using only 4 main functions:
  1. setup() - to initialize the board and position of snake's head and fruit.
  2. Draw() - to draw the whole game 
  3. Input() - detects input taken from user (if any)
  4. Logic() - this function has the logic of the game

Disclaimer: this game will work only on windows (because it uses a DOS header <conio.h>)
To run the game, simply run the code on code blocks and enjoy.
